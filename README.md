# SoPra FS22 - Group 18 Roast me

## Introduction

“Roast Me!” is a game, where a user can host a roasting session and upload a picture, e.g. of a meal they cooked, a sweater they are wearing, or their pet. 

Other users can then join the roasting session as participants, and comment on the picture, making fun of it. 

The host will decide at the end of the session which participant wins the game.

## Launch & Deployment

## Roadmap
1. In the future, you could set up a lobby where you can wait for participants to enter after the game starts. 
2. In addition, it would be useful to be able to see your own post and comment history. 
3. It would also be interesting if users could send voice messages or videos while "roasting" pictures.
